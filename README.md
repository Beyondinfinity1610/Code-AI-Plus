## 🎭 What's This Magical Creation?

Ever wished you had a coding buddy who:
- Never judges your variable names? ✅
- Explains errors without saying "it works on my machine"? ✅  
- Doesn't eat your lunch from the office fridge? ✅
- Actually helps you improve your code? ✅

**Meet Code Assist Plus!** Your AI-powered coding companion that's more helpful than Stack Overflow and less sarcastic than your senior developer! 😄

## 🌟 Features That'll Make You Go "Wow!" 

### 🤖 AI-Powered Assistant
- **Error Whisperer**: Explains your bugs in human language (finally!)
- **Code Therapist**: Answers your deep questions about that mysterious function
- **Improvement Guru**: Suggests better ways to write code (politely)

### 💻 Multi-Language Support
Because we don't discriminate against programming languages:
- JavaScript (the popular kid)
- Python (the snake charmer)
- Java (the enterprise favorite)
- C++ (the speed demon)
- HTML/CSS (the design duo)

### 🏗️ Built With Love (and These Technologies)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (because life's too short for slow builds)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (the classic combo)
- **Database**: MongoDB (for all your data hoarding needs)
- **AI**: Google Gemini (the smart one in the room)
- **Code Execution**: Judge0 (the stern but fair judge)

## 🚀 Getting Started (AKA "How to Wake Up the Beast")

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have these installed, or the code gods will be angry:
- Node.js 18+ (anything older and you're living in the past)
- MongoDB (for data storage magic)
- A sense of humor (mandatory for debugging)

### Installation Dance 💃

1. **Clone this beauty**
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Code-AI-Plus.git
cd Code-AI-Plus

2. **Feed the dependencies**
Backend first (it's hungry)
cd server
npm install

Frontend next (it's also hungry)
cd ../client
npm install


3. **Set up your secrets** (Create a `.env` file)
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_that_nobody_should_know
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
JUDGE0_API_KEY=your_judge0_api_key

4. **Start the magic**
Backend (in server directory)
npm run dev

Frontend (in client directory)
npm run dev
